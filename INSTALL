-----------------------------------------------------------------
Installation with "setup.php"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Untar the package into a directory then copy the contents of
   the "html" folder into your web site directory.

   tar -xjpvf torrentflux-ng*.tar.bz2

2. ensure the files + dirs in the docroot are readable by your
   webserver-user. if it is not the case one possible solution is
   to "chown" the files to your webserver-user. this may be done
   with a line like that :
   chown -R username /path/to/torrentflux-docroot
   change dir + username to fit your system so a possible line
   would be :
   chown -R www-data /var/www

3. ensure the dir "inc/config/" in your torrentflux-docroot is
   writable by your webserver-user.

4. open "setup.php" in a browser and complete it step by step.

5. IMPORTANT:  The first time you access the application, you
   will be prompted for a user/password -- this is when you will
   set the SUPER ADMIN user and password by what you enter.  For
   example, you pull the site up for the first time, you will
   be prompted to login and if you put in user: 'goombah' and
   password: 'iama' then your super admin user account will
   be set to goombah/iama.

6. On your first login you should check all the admin settings
   pages and configure your installation.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Manual Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. Untar the package into a directory then copy the contents of
   the "html" folder into your web site directory.

   tar -xjvf torrentflux-ng*.tar.bz2

2. Create a database and import the sql-script.
   You may specify the type of the database you want to use in
   the file "config.db.php", but the examples here use MySQL.

   mysqladmin create torrentflux

   "mysql_torrentflux-b4rt-1.0.sql" contains the commands to
   build the table structure and the default data. Import the
   script into your torrentflux database (from sql directory).

   ./sqlscript.php.sh mysql install > mysql_TorrentFlux-NG-1.0.sql

   mysql torrentflux < mysql_TorrentFlux-NG-1.0.sql
   Or load the script with PHPMyAdmin (web interface)

3. rename the file "config.db.php.dist" in the dir "inc/config/"
   to "config.db.php" and set the database-settings to use your
   torrentflux-database.
   You may specify type of database you want to use, but
   the examples here use MySQL.

4. ensure the files + dirs in the docroot are readable by your
   webserver-user. if it is not the case one possible solution is
   to "chown" the files to your webserver-user. this may be done
   with a line like that :
   chown -R username /path/to/torrentflux-docroot
   change dir + username to fit your system so a possible line
   would be :
   chown -R www-data /var/www

5. Remove or rename the file /path/to/torrentflux-docroot/setup.php.
   This is a security precaution to ensure a malicious user does not
   attempt to overwrite your torrentflux-b4rt installation.  Your
   installation will not run with setup.php in the document root folder.

6. IMPORTANT:  The first time you access the application, you
   will be prompted for a user/password -- this is when you will
   set the SUPER ADMIN user and password by what you enter.  For
   example, you pull the site up for the first time, you will
   be prompted to login and if you put in user: 'goombah' and
   password: 'iama' then your super admin user account will
   be set to goombah/iama.

7. On your first login you should check all the admin settings
   pages and configure your installation.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrade from TorrentFlux-b4rt with "upgrade.php"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1. If QueueManager is running dequeue all torrents and stop it.

2. Stop all transfers and delete them. (data-delete/reset/wipe is
   not needed, delete is enough)

3. Delete content of docroot of the v9x-installation. (recursive)

4. Untar the package into a directory then copy the contents of
   the "html" folder into your web site directory.

   tar -jxvf torrentflux-b4rt_1.0.tar.bz2

5. ensure the files + dirs in the docroot are readable by your
   webserver-user. if it is not the case one possible solution is
   to "chown" the files to your webserver-user. this may be done
   with a line like that :
   chown -R username /path/to/torrentflux-docroot
   change dir + username to fit your system so a possible line
   would be :
   chown -R www-data /var/www

6. ensure the dir "inc/config/" in your torrentflux-docroot is
   writable by your webserver-user.

7. copy the file "upgrade.php" from the dir "upgrade/v9x_1.0/" to
   your torrentflux-docroot. choose the appropriate version.

8. open the just copied file "upgrade.php" in a browser and
   complete it step by step.

9. Remove or rename the file /path/to/torrentflux-docroot/setup.php.
   This is a security precaution to ensure a malicious user does not
   attempt to overwrite your torrentflux-b4rt installation.  Your
   installation will not run with setup.php in the document root folder.

10. On your first login after the upgrade you should check all the
    admin settings pages and configure your installation.

   update from TorrentFlux 2.3.

   "mysql_update_torrentflux23.to.torrentflux-b4rt-1.0.sql"
   contains the commands to update the table structure and the
   default data.
   Import the script into your torrentflux database.

   on a default install this would be :
   /usr/local/torrent/.torrents/
    ->
   /usr/local/torrent/.transfers/

9. rename stat-files and prio-files.
   Note: it is also possible to just delete all transfers before upgrading and
         then re-inject after upgrade. (then this point can be skipped)
   change to your path-dir. (the dir just renamed in 8.) on a
   default install this would be :
   cd /usr/local/torrent/.transfers/
   execute this commands (requires perl) in that dir :
   ls -1 *.torrent | perl -e 'while(<STDIN>){chomp;$o=lc(((substr($_,0,(length($_))-7))))."stat";$n=$_.".stat";print $o."->".$n;print `mv $o $n;echo`;}'
   ls -1 *.prio | perl -e 'while(<STDIN>){chomp;$o=$_;$n=((substr($_,0,(length($_))-4)))."torrent.prio";print $o."->".$n;print `mv $o $n;echo`;}'
