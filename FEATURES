Torrentflux-b4rt FEATURES file
**********************************************************************/

	Some of the most popular features of torrentflux-b4rt are listed
	below.

	NOTE! This list is definitely NOT exhaustive, there are
	a massive number of features that can be configured via the
	torrentflux-b4rt admin panel!

	o Supports multiple internet transfer protocols:

		- BitTorrent - supported client(s) include:

			* Original BitTorrent/Mainline - supports trackerless
			  torrents and encryption

			* BitTornado - uses slightly less resources than the original
			  BT, allows file priority for downloading files selectively

			* Transmission - much smaller memory footprint without much
			  loss in functionality

			* Azureus - control a number of transfers from a single
			  control process, tighter control on total max bandwidth
			  for all torrents

		- HTTP/FTP - supported client(s) include:

			* wget - standard lightweight file transfer utility on
			  Linux, supported on many other platforms also

		- Usenet - supported client(s) include:

			* nzbperl - perl based application allowing multi-connection
			  news server downloads from nzb files with functionality
			  for bandwidth throttling.

	o Unified transfer control:

		- Perform stop/start/resume/kill/delete operations on individual
		  transfers, all transfers or a selection of transfers

        - Changes Settings of running transfers on the fly - down/up
		  rates, what ratio to stop seeding at, how many connections to
		  use at same time, ...

	o Individual Transfers 'remember' their own settings, allowing you
	  to use different settings for different Transfers.

	o View torrent Transfer information:

		- cumulative transfer statistics are available for every
		  transfer in the transfer list. tfb keeps track of how much
		  data has been transfered up and down even when you stop and
		  restart the transfer.  This allows you to keep track of what
		  your actual ratio is rather than what the current session
		  ratio is.

		- logfiles are maintained for each and every torrent, allowing
		  you to easily see when problems occur with your transfers.

		- current upload/download bandwidth rate as well as the number
		  of seeds/peers and estimated time left is viewable in the
		  transfer list

	o Transfer statistics and logging:

		- View detailed Transfer statistics and information, including:

			* per transfer error logging for easy troubleshooting
			* upload/download totals for each user, by day/month/year
			* number of seeders/leechers for a torrent in a graphical
			  display

	o Uploading and injection of metafiles (.torrent, .wget, .nzb files):

		- Upload single or multiple metafiles from your local machine
		  to the web server

		- Upload metafiles directly to your web server from another
		  web server

        - Multiple operations in "fluxcli.php" allow inject and more
          from command-line (cron, etc.)
          eg.: "inject", "watch", "rss"

	o fluxcli.php - a complete command-line version of torrentflux-b4rt:

		- As mentioned, can perform all the tasks available in the
		  torrentflux-b4rt frontend but from the commandline.  Makes it
		  ideal for running from a cron job.

		- Schedule cron jobs to check RSS feeds on a regular basis and
		  download them to a directory.

		- Schedule cron jobs to watch folders for new torrent files and
		  then autostart/inject them

		- Check up on the status of transfers directly from a Unix shell

	o Fluxd - background perl daemon to perform scheduled tasks:

		- Qmgr module handles queueing of transfers with per-user and
		  global limits.  Add transfers to the queue and Qmgr will
		  automatically start one transfer after another finishes.

		- automate fetching of torrent files from RSS feeds

		- watch a list of directories for new upload of torrent files
		  and automatically start those torrents running

	o Integrated Filemanager:

		- Support for a large number of additional third party
		  utilities/functionality, including:

			* archive file extraction from the browser (zip/rar)

			* vlc streaming controllable from browser

			* download of completed transfers directly from browser

			* reading of .nfo files directly in the browser

			* creation of torrent files directly in the browser

	o AJAX updates for maximum info with minimal bandwidth:

		- Display of transfer lists can be easily configured to use AJAX
		  to update transfer stats in real time.  This saves on
		  bandwidth since only the transfer list needs to be sent across
		  the network, not the whole web page.

		- Individual transfer windows can also use AJAX to update stats
		  in real time.

	o Templating engine:

		- The torrentflux-b4rt GUI is template driven using the vLib
		  template engine:

			http://vlib.clausvb.de/vlibtemplate.php

		  This allows developers to completely redesign the look and
		  feel of torrentflux-b4rt without having to worry about the
		  underlying PHP codebase.

		- Torrentflux-b4rt also incorporates template caching to speed
		  up the load time of pages.  This feature can be enabled via
		  the Administration control panel.
